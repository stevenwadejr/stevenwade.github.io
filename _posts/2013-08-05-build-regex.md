Regular Expressions, does anyone actually like them? I suck at them. If you&#8217;re like me at all, you struggle with them too. When I need to use regular expressions, I spend countless amounts of time on <a href="http://regexpal.com/" target="_blank">RegexPal</a> trying to find just the right combination. That&#8217;s why I built <a href="http://buildregex.com/" target="_blank">Build RegEx</a>.

This week, I discovered <a href="https://github.com/jehna/VerbalExpressions" target="_blank">VerbalExpressions</a>. Oh my! Regex made simple! What could be better than this? A GUI!! Thanks to the suggestion of my buddy <a href="http://mikecr.it/" target="_blank">Mike Crittenden</a>, I decided to make a simple GUI that uses the VerbalExpressions JavaScript library. Here you go world! Enjoy!

Feedback welcome (comments and bugs).
